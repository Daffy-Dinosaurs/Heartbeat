## Purpose

Heartbeat is an interactive global map that allows our users to see visual representations of key data sets provided to the application. Currently Heartbeat is set to display data from acquired from the World Bank, the FAO, and the WHO. We hope this can be used as a tool to highlight important issues and be leveraged to produce educational value and awareness toward these key topics.

#####The three datasets represent:

##### POVERTY: Percentage of population who survive on $3.90 USD per day

##### SAFE DRINKING WATER
Data received from the World Bank shows the percentage of population that has access to improved drinkable water. Access to an improved water resources within households includes the use of standard pipes, tube wells, boreholes, fresh water reservoirs that are able to provide clean water for cooking and drinking.

The dataset includes the improved water resource since the year 1960, however this includes a very small subset of countries. Since 1990, all countries have been reporting their indicator for improved water resource to the [World Health Organization](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.H2O.SAFE.ZS) (WHO).

"The Global water crisis also includes water pollution, because to be useful for drinking, cooking and irrigation, water must not be polluted. According to the World Health Organization, in 2008 approximately 880 million people in the world (or 13% of world population) did not have access to safe drinking water." At the same time, about 2.6 billion people (or 40% of the world population) lived without improved sanitation.

##### FOOD SCARCITY: Prevalence of Undernourishment
The FAO measure of food deprivation, which is referred to as the prevalence of undernourishment, is based on a comparison of usual food consumption expressed in terms of dietary energy (kcal) with certain energy requirement norms. The part of the population with food consumption below the energy requirement norm is considered undernourished ("underfed").

We have also integrated the usage of Twitter and various news outlets to give our users a holistic understanding of the factual evidence, the media representation, and on the ground reality of the people experiencing the effects of these issues.
